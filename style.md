However, there are some generally preferred conventions:

- Opening braces should be on the same line as the declaration

## Functions

Functions should begin with a lower-case letter.

```go
func add(a, b, c int) int {
    return a + b + c
}
```

## Events

Events should begin with an upper-case letter.

```go
event Add(a, b, c int)
```

## Classes

Classes should begin with an upper-case letter.

```go
class Dog {

}
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces should begin with an upper-case letter.

```go
interface Dog {

}
```

## Contracts

Contracts should begin with an upper-case letter.

```go
contract Dog {

}
```
